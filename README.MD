This is one of several projects to demonstrate usage of vanilla usage of JS. No frameworks like JQuery, etc. Just plain old JS.

This project originates from and is largely based on a tutuorial from Wes Bos. 

This project demonstrates a few things:

* JS query selection of classes.
* Usage of setInterval timer, called every second (1000ms) in this example.
* Usage of Date JS object.
* Dynamic application of CSS style transform, in this case rotation.
* Usage of a cubic-bezier timing function. See http://cubic-bezier.com
* Demonstration of various CSS styles to perform basic graphics, like 
  drawing round clock faces, lines for clock hands, etc.
* Temporarily removing a CSS style (in this case transition).

To view this project, simply clone it, and open index.html in your browswer. No databases, routing, or any backend required.
